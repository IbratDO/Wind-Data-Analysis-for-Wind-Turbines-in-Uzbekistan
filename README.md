# Wind-Data-Analysis-for-Wind-Turbines-in-Uzbekistan
In this file I did some research and analyzed weather data, in particular wind data, in order to assess weather it is 
effective to use wind power to generate electricity in Uzbekistan. 
This project is my first one and may be some mistakes or may not give enough info and insight. Sorry for that!!!
I have to mention that the data used in this project is collective, does not include regional wind speed which could not make the analysis precise.
I would be happy to reach me out with new ideas or contributions to the development of that project
